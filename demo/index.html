            <h2>See for yourself</h2>
            <p>We have build a Todo extension to showcase the features of Nooku Framework and installed it on our demo site.</p>
            <p>This demo site is specially designed to refresh itself every hour. You might not be the only person using the demo site at this time, so you may see unexpected things happen occasionally.</p>

            <h2>Do it yourself</h2>
            <p>If you want to dig into the code of a working Todo extension, you can set it up yourself using Composer. Simply go to the root folder of a local Joomla installation and run the following command:</p>
{% highlight bash %}
$ composer require nooku/pkg_todo:dev-master
{% endhighlight %}
			<p>Our <a href="http://guides.nooku.org/getting-started.html">Getting Started tutorial</a> guides you through the inner workings of the Todo component and explains how it all fits together.</p>
