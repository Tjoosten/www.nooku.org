## The Todo Package

We've been hard at work getting some of our supporting documentation together. That's not just the new Todo Component Tutorial series
we've put together. We believe in "Letting the code do the talking" so we have also put together an more complete Todo Package
that you can get some nice working examples of how even more parts of the Framework operate.

In that package we use the bootstrapper, specialized table objects, behaviors, dispatchers, models, template helpers, views.
There's even a great example of tying your Todo items into searching, and displaying your items in a module.

[Get It on Github](https://github.com/nooku/joomla-todo)

Better yet, just run this command this command in your Joomla root directory

```shell
composer require nooku/joomla-todo:1.*
```

## Help Getting Started...

Getting started is sometimes the hardest part about trying out a new Framework. Concepts, structure, how things get done and why.
There is no Question that Nooku is powerful, and getting started with it doesn't need to be hard. We've taken a step by step approach to get you off the ground

In this turorial series we cover

## [Setup](http://guides.nooku.org/get-started/set-up.md)

Some quick tips getting set up with the Joomlatools Vagrant Box, and installing the Framework with composer. Its super easy and we show you how.

## [Frontend](http://guides.nooku.org/get-started/com_todo-frontend.md)

After you have your environment up and running, we do the Front side of a Todo component. You'll register the component with
the extensions table in the database, create views and add records to the database.

* [Register the Component](http://guides.nooku.org/get-started/register-the-component.md)
* [Component Entry Point](http://guides.nooku.org/get-started/component-entry-point.md)
* [Hello World!](http://guides.nooku.org/get-started/hello-world-todos.md)
* [The Database Table](http://guides.nooku.org/get-started/creating-the-database.md)
* [Your First Todo List View](http://guides.nooku.org/get-started/your-first-todo-list-view.md)

## [Backend](http://guides.nooku.org/get-started/com_todo-backend.md)

What good would a Joomla Component Tutorial be without touching on the most important points of the backend. We do that and
also try to bring forward some important concepts. You will create more views, add toolbars, and learn a little about the dispatcher.

* [Component Entry Point](get-started/backend-entry-point.md)
* [Create a View](get-started/create-a-view.md)
* [The Dispatcher](get-started/the-dispatcher.md)

* [Toolbar for List View](get-started/add-toolbar-to-list-view.md)

After completing this complete tutorial series you've be well on your way to being a Nooku Framework officianado. You'll see
some of the Magic that lets you write much less code for your given application, and get comfortable with some of the productivity tools
that allow you to write code, instead of setting up instances of Joomla.
