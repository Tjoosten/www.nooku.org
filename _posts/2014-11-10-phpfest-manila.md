Calling all PHP developers in and around **Manila** to join us for the first ever PHPFest on **Friday 21th November 2014 from 6pm till 10pm** at [PaletExpress](http://www.paletexpress.com/our-spaces/manila-palet-express/).

## What's this all about?

PHPFest is an open, participatory event, whose content is provided by participants. The concept is very similar to a [barcamp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp). No scheduled talks, or fixed agendas. Anybody can speak on any topic that they are passionate about.

## Lightning talks

During PHPFest we will open the floor for lightning talks. We would love to hear all the great stuff that is happening in **Drupal**, **Wordpress**, **Joomla**, … what new libraries are being worked on in **Lavarel**, **Symfony**, **Zend**, … What great tools you use and love for developing with PHP?

What cool things are you working on yourself? Come and tell us about it! You get **10 minutes**, no slides required.

## All about community

Anyone with something to contribute or with the desire to learn is welcome and invited to join. When you come, be prepared to share with others. When you leave, be prepared to share it with the world.

## Will there be drinks and food?

Of course! You can drop right in after work, drinks and food will be waiting.

## Register now

See you on the 21th!
