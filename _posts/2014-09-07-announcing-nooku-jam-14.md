## What is a Nooku Jam?

A Nooku Jam is an open, participatory workshop-event, whose content is provided by participants. The concept is very similar to a [barcamp](http://barcamp.org/w/page/405173/TheRulesOfBarCamp). It is an intense event with discussions, demos and interaction from the attendees.

Nooku Jams are never your traditional conferences – they are more of an ad-hoc unconference born from the desire for people to share and learn in an open environment.  Anybody can speak on any topic that they are passionate about. For Nooku developers, this means their latest code, component or project.

## There are no spectators, only participants.

Attendees are expected to give a demo, a session, or help with one, or otherwise volunteer / contribute in some way to support the event. Participants won’t need to decide what to talk about until they get there. All presentations are scheduled the day they happen.

The day starts with the session suggestions. Everybody describes the kind of session they can do. Then the session gets pinned on the board for a certain time slot. After the planning – voila – there is a schedule and the sessions start.

## It’s always about community

Anyone with something to contribute or with the desire to learn is welcome and invited to join a Nooku Jam. When you come, be prepared to share with other attendees. When you leave, be prepared to share it with the world.

The jam is the perfect event for Nooku magic offline! [Register today](http://www.nooku.org/nj14/), we only have room for 50 people!
