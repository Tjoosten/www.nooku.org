Today we are extremely proud to release our new Nooku site. More then [6 years ago](http://www.nooku.org/blog/2008/04/party-time-%E2%80%94-website-launch/) we set out to create a multi-lingual extension for [Joomla](http://www.joomla.org/), a year later we [launched Nooku Framework](http://www.nooku.org/blog/2009/05/nooku-framework-the-api-that-speaks-for-itself/) to help developers create custom Joomla extensions.

In September 2012, and after 3 years of hard work [Nooku Framework 1.0](https://github.com/nooku/nooku-framework/releases) stable was released with support for Joomla 1.5, 2.5 and 3.x. After the 1.0 release our focus shifted to Nooku Platform - a fork of Joomla 1.5 - which we [build for the Belgian Police](http://www.nooku.org/blog/2014/09/belgian-police-web-platform-uses-nooku/).

Last summer we decided to pick development up again and start work on [Nooku Framework 2.0](https://github.com/nooku/nooku-framework). Support for Joomla 1.5 was dropped and the framework got a complete refactor to make the architecture even leaner. One year, [2500 commits](https://github.com/nooku/nooku-framework/graphs/contributors), 2000+ man hours, and many cups of coffee later we are ready!

With Nooku Framework 2.0 we are going back to our Joomla roots! The 2.0 stable version will be released in the coming days. Together with the new site we are also launching our [developer guides](http://guides.nooku.org/) and [API reference](http://api.nooku.org/) for Nooku Framework 2.0.

Big kudos goes to all [Timble developers](http://www.timble.net/about/#our-team) and Nooku contributors who helped to grow Nooku in the past 6 years.

Thank you!
