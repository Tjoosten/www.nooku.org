On **29 &amp; 30 October 2014**, the yearly-ish Nooku Jam was held. The [Moyo Web Architects](http://www.moyoweb.nl/) team was there with a stronger presence than ever. As one of the organizers put it, we keep spawning. Five of us were there. Two of us did presentations and one of us tells his story.

## Venue

For a regular Nooku Jam attendee the venue was familiar: the [Flanders DC](http://flandersdc.be/) Creativity Lab in Leuven, Belgium. Conveniently located near the train station and on walking distance from the city center with its many restaurants and pubs. It is the ideal place to let the creativity (and coffee!) flow first and let the beer flow later.

The Jam itself was held along its traditional [barcamp](http://barcamp.org/w/page/405173/TheRulesOfBarCamp) format. There was no preset agenda. Attendees were encouraged to share their ideas and wishes on the [Wall of Ideas&trade;](https://twitter.com/sittcomm/status/527395866311917568/photo/1). A vote was cast for the favorite subjects and the ones with most votes were planned as a presentation.

## First Day

The first day had the customary talk about the roadmap and recent changes in the framework and platform by [Johan Janssens](https://twitter.com/johanjanssens). He also explained about the philosophy behind Nooku. It distinguishes itself from other frameworks by being not only a framework, but rather a complete architecture.

A good tradition was held up by house philosopher [Herman Peeren](https://twitter.com/HermanPeeren). Herman talked about the [DCI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data,_context_and_interaction) design pattern, which is not only relatively unknown, but hardly used in any PHP framework. Of course, Nooku does support it. Johan showed us.

[Steven Rombauts](https://twitter.com/stevenrombauts) did an interesting talk on [Elasticsearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/), a Lucene-based multilingual full-text search engine. [Robin Poort](https://twitter.com/rhcpoort) discussed [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) and how he used it to automate repetitive development-related tasks.

Special guest this year was [Rastin Mehr](https://twitter.com/rastin), developer of [Anahita](http://getanahita.com/), an open source knowledge networking platform. He explained how his implementation was inspired by naturally occurring patterns, such as the migration of ants. His talk was quite impressive and he was awarded with the ['most interesting talk' award](http://instagram.com/p/uyyL6fEoh4/?utm_source=partner&utm_medium=embed&utm_campaign=photo&modal=true).

## Second Day

Two themes were particularly characteristic to this edition of the Nooku Jam. There was much focus on mobile development and Javascript frameworks. Both were extensively covered during the second day.

[Tom Janssens](https://twitter.com/janssenstom) and [Robin Poort](https://twitter.com/rhcpoort) discussed the Mobile First and Progressive Enhancement theorems. In order to support any platform and resolution, one should start from the smallest resolution and work up to the big desktop-sized resolutions. Also, one should start designing with only HTML and CSS in mind and enhance upon this basic design.

At the same time, our own [Jasper van Rijbroek](https://twitter.com/JaspervanRijbro) demonstrated one of his weekend projects: [Raddish](https://github.com/JaspervRijbroek/raddish), a framework written in [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) that follows the Nooku architecture. His talk was regarded one of the most interesting talks of the entire Jam.

Our developer [Joep van der Heijden](https://twitter.com/Klaasvaak_) did a talk on [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com/) and how he made it play nice with Nooku. He demonstrated it by showing off one of our projects, a frontend to a shared content repository.

Long time Nooku contributor and former colleague [Dave Li](https://twitter.com/holeedave) gave a further explanation on a number of frameworks aimed at mobile development. It started as an introduction to the [Ionic framework](http://ionicframework.com/), but evolved into a comparison of several competitors. [Phonegap](http://phonegap.com/) was discussed, as well as [Titanium](http://www.appcelerator.com/titanium/).

Day two ended with the usual lightning talks on interesting apps, a well-improvised talk by Herman Peeren on -amongst others- the first encyclopedia and a [reminder](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat) of how some programming languages misbehave by Dave Li.

## Afterword

The Nooku Jam ended for me with a long motorcycle ride. In order to prevent being hypnotized by the dark roads, I mulled over everything I saw and heard. It was my first Jam as a non-developer, but I would not wanted to miss this Jam. The community is awesome! Their collective knowledge, drive and love of sharing is reason enough to go. However, what I saw in terms of interesting techniques made me second guess my decision to stop developing. Stick to the code, right?!
